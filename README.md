# Churn-prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn using multiple machine learning models and comparing them. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon of customers ceasing their relationship with a company. Predicting churn is crucial for businesses as it allows them to identify and retain customers who are likely to leave, thus minimizing revenue loss and maintaining customer satisfaction.

## Introduction
The project utilizes an adaptation of IBM's Telco Customer Churn dataset containing information about customers' demographics, tenure, contract, payment method, account details, services availed, and churn status. Multiple machine learning models, including XGBoost, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), random forest, and gradient boosting, are trained and evaluated to predict customer churn.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding, and normalizing numerical features.
- Exploratory data analysis: Visualizing the distribution of churn and exploring the influence of various attributes on customer churn (feature importance).
- Model training: Implementing multiple machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Model evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, balanced accuracy, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).
- Interpretability: Visualizing the decision tree generated by XGBoost to understand feature importance and model predictions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 (or above)
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
